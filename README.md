# cs100f2019-lab1-starter

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter files for Laboratory 1 assignment in Computer Science 100.

## Introduction

This assignment requires a student to write a one-paragraph report,
stored in the file `writing/report.md`, that reflects on the directory
navigation tasks. This is a Markdown file that must
adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax
Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Remember, you
can preview the contents of a committed Markdown file by clicking on the name
of the file in your GitHub repository.

Available for download at the course website [course
website](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/jjumadinova/teaching/100/labs.html),
the carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the
